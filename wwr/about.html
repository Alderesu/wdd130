            <h2>History</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"> &emsp;Founded in 1824, "Whitewater Rafting" has been a pioneer in the whitewater rafting industry for two centuries. 
                The company was started by a group of adventurous explorers who were captivated by the thrill of navigating the wild rapids of the Colorado River. 
                Over the years, Whitewater Rafting has built a reputation for providing safe and exhilarating rafting experiences, while also educating customers about the importance of environmental stewardship and the preservation of natural resources. 
                Today, Whitewater Rafting is still family-owned and operated, and continues to be a leader in the whitewater rafting industry, offering a wide range of trips and adventures for thrill-seekers of all ages and skill levels.</p>
